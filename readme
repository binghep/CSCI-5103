How to use:----------------------------------------------------------------------------
run make.

the executable HybridScheduler will be created and run. 






Other info:----------------------------------------------------------------------------
input time quantum and some other info before starting scheduling.

comment out #define DEBUG  on line 28 if want less debugging info printed to the terminal.

change the variable "useTimer" to true if want to utilize SetiTimer() virtual timer functionality, but it is very slow compared to not using it.

output file: output.txt (can be over 200MB if we have 1 million processes) 
=============input file====================
input file: 2 files provided or user specifed file(must be in this directory).

The first line(Header line) is ignored.

if the input file contains duplicated pids, then we maintain another red black tree to sanitize the input file lines.
if not sure, choose 'yes'(it contains dupPids). 

if the input file contains symbols that are not integers, you can choose to ignore that line or exit beforehand. 
===========================================


framework by others are specified at the beginning of HybridScheduler.cpp

HybridScheduler.h contains all the declarations of functions in HybridScheduler.cpp so that we don't need to move functions around in .cpp

valgrind checked. no memory leak detected.
